"""Filename headers on embedded snippets.

Every code fence that embeds a compiled snippet (a ``--8<--`` include) gets a Material
``title="<path>"`` header naming the source file, and the rendered header links to the file on
GitHub - so a reader can jump from any excerpt to the full compiled example. Fences that already
carry an explicit ``title=`` (for example the scaffold walkthrough titling a block
``src/main.rs``) are left alone.

The title is injected in the markdown phase, before pymdownx.snippets resolves the include; the
link is wrapped in the HTML phase, because Material renders the title as a plain
``<span class="filename">``.
