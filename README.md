`ruststream-zeromq` will implement the [RustStream](https://github.com/powersemmi/ruststream) broker contract over the pure-Rust [`zeromq`](https://crates.io/crates/zeromq) implementation. Handlers, routers, codecs, and middleware come from the framework; this crate supplies the transport - and nothing broker-specific leaks back into the framework.

## Status

**Not implemented yet.** This repository is a scaffold: the workspace, CI, and release plumbing are in place, and the crate is an empty stub. The implementation will target the `ruststream` 0.6 line; the design and scope are tracked in [powersemmi/ruststream#192](https://github.com/powersemmi/ruststream/issues/192).

## Planned surface

- Three socket patterns for three messaging shapes: `ZmqQueue` (PUSH/PULL), `ZmqFanout` (PUB/SUB), `ZmqRpc` (DEALER/ROUTER).
- Explicit bind-or-connect endpoints over TCP and IPC, since which side listens is a deployment decision.
- A simple, documented, stable three-frame wire layout (name, headers, payload) with an example for a non-Rust peer.
- Honest scope: at-most-once delivery, no durability, acknowledgement reported as unsupported rather than emulated, per-pattern high-water-mark behaviour made configurable.

The broker contract (lazy startup, the typed connect/shutdown lifecycle, and the optional capability traits) is defined by [`ruststream`](https://crates.io/crates/ruststream) and verified by `ruststream::conformance`, with the suite run against a real broker before release.
