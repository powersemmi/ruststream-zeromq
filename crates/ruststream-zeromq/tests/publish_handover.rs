//! What this crate does with the buffer the framework hands it on the publish path.
//!
//! Both publishers here declare `Take`, so the payload arrives as the buffer the codec wrote and
//! the frame is made of it rather than from a copy of it. Content equality cannot tell the two
//! apart, so these tests compare the address the buffer was written at.
